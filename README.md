This Java code is designed to help an employer hire the most cost-effective candidates for a job. The program reads in the number of people applying for the job, followed by their salaries and professions. The professions are represented by integers: 1 for typist, 2 for author, and 3 for someone who is both a typist and an author. The program then computes the minimum salary for each profession and determines whether it is more cost-effective to hire a typist and an author or someone who is both a typist and an author. Finally, the program outputs the most cost-effective hiring strategy.
